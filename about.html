            <h1>Info about me</h1>
			<br />

			<p>I, Daniel Webi&#246;rn, am a graduated student from EC Utbildning practical college with the program Web Developer in .Net. Since July of 2017 I work at Apcoa Parking Sverige AB as a Systems Developer in C#/.Net.</p>
			<p>I have been programming to and fro since elementary school, and have a great interest for backend programming and algorithms and getting down to the details of the structure of programs.</p>
			<p>I've worked, and still do, in C++ because of the beauty of the lightweight, no-nonsense approach to programming. Currently I have some arduino projects in progress.</p>
			<p>In my education I have gotten pretty deep into C# and the .Net framework, with lots of LINQ and Reflection programming which is really fun. Both Windows forms and MVC.</p>
			<p>Away from the keyboard I volunteer as a Scout leader, help a local church as a sound technician, and grow as many crops as I can fit on my tiny colony lot.</p>
